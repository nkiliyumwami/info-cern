    <h1>General Overview</h1>
    There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web.
    You can look at it from many points of view.
    If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for
    information.
    <dl>
        <dt><a href=bySubject/Overview.html>by Subject</a> </dt>
        <dd>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete
            but easiest to use. </dd>
        <dt><a href=ByAccess.html>by Type</a> </dt>
        <dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc)
            may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.</dd>
    </dl>
    If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node
    or the subject list.
